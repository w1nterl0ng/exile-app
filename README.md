# Executive Agile Project (Exile)
This app will be a lightweight version of JIRA made for executives.  The core functionality will be based around:

* Users
* Epics
* Stories
* States
* Projects

I put Projects last.  I know it seems odd as Projects house epics, but epics are really the heart of things.  A project would be similar to a "Theme".  You can have an epic that is not tied to a project.  Calling this an orphan would not do it justice, so we will simply call it independant.

### Users
When you arrive at the site you will be asked to login or create an account.   Once you are in the site

### States
States are the equivilant of columns.  You can create a defualt set of states when a project is created.  Additionally you should be able to edit the states as you see fit.

### More to Come...
